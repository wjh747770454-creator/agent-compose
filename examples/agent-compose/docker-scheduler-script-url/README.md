# Scheduler script URL example

Languages: English | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

This example keeps QJS in `scheduler.js` and references it from
`agent-compose.yml` with `scheduler.script.url`.

```bash
agent-compose config
agent-compose up
agent-compose ps
agent-compose down
```

`config` prints the fetched script inline. `up` fetches it once more, hashes the
content snapshot, and sends only script text to the daemon. Editing
`scheduler.js` takes effect on the next `up`. The relative path is resolved from
the directory containing `agent-compose.yml`.

The control-plane commands do not require provider authentication. A scheduled
run does require a working guest runtime and provider credentials.
